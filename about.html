    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Nina is a visual communicator, storyteller, textile artist and illustrator. </p>
    <p>If observing were a job she’d take it. She bases her art on experiences and inner dialogues, the smaller things she notices and the parts of conversations she'd catch.</p>
	<p>Her need to better understand the world and give others a new way to look at things is what drives her work.</p>
	<p>Currently based in Rotterdam focusing her work on textile art in the form of tufting, she's inspired and excited to see where this medium will bring her. </p>
